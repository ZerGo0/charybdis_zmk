# Charybdis ZMK Firmware

> [!WARNING]
> This is a working keymap for this AliExpress Charybdis keyboard: https://a.aliexpress.com/_Ev6kgX8
>
> I would not recommend buying it from AliExpress because it doesn't support the original creator: [bastardkb](https://bastardkb.com/charybdis/).
>
> The AliExpress seller offers little to no support and you are pretty much on your own.

> [!CAUTION]
> This fork is what works for me. Use at your own risk!
